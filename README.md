# Diatony: a diatonic model of tonal harmony
This repository contains a constraint formalization of general western tonal music rules for diatonic harmony using constraint programming. It is mainly based on the book "L'harmonie en libert√©" by Isabelle Duha, and the book "Harmonic Practice in Tonal Music" by Robert Gauldin. The constraint solver used for modeling the rules is [Gecode](http://www.gecode.org/). This repository includes the midifile library (https://github.com/craigsapp/midifile) to generate MIDI files.
